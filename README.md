Tiny webapp for mental-math training (static HTML/JS, GitHub Pages friendly).

## Current focus
- Fast MCQ drills across arithmetic, algebra, calculus, probability, and linear algebra.
- Topics relevant to ML/quant prep (Bayes, expectation/variance, matrix ops, determinants, inverses).
- Mobile-first UX so it works as an iPhone home-screen app.

## New in this update
- Session length selector (10/15/20) for mixed sprints.
- Live session stats (streak + running accuracy).
- Expanded question bank with more probability and linear algebra problem types.
- More robust answer option generation that always includes the correct answer.
